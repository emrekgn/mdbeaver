# Terms of Service

Last updated: 2024-06-05

Thank you for using **mdbeaver**, a client-side Google Drive “Open with” Markdown editor. By choosing to launch or authorize the app, you agree to the terms below.

## 1. Description of the Service
mdbeaver is a static web application that runs entirely in your browser. After you grant OAuth permissions, the app reads and updates Markdown files stored in your Google Drive. No servers controlled by the developer receive, store, or transmit your file contents.

## 2. Eligibility and Google Policies
You must have a Google account and comply with all applicable Google Terms of Service, Drive policies, and OAuth consent requirements. If Google revokes the permissions you granted, mdbeaver will no longer function for you.

## 3. Your Responsibilities
- Keep your Google account secure and do not share access tokens or devices with untrusted parties.
- Review file changes before saving. mdbeaver replaces the full contents of the destination file during each save.
- Maintain backup copies of critical files. The developer is not responsible for deleted or corrupted data.

## 4. Acceptable Use
You may not use mdbeaver to store or distribute content that violates laws, regulations, or other parties’ rights. Reverse engineering or attempting to circumvent Drive API limits is prohibited.

## 5. Privacy
The application only processes information that you explicitly load through Google Drive. Refer to the accompanying [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY_POLICY.md) for details on data handling.

## 6. Warranty Disclaimer
mdbeaver is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. The developer does not guarantee availability, error-free operation, or compatibility with future Google APIs.

## 7. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, the developer will not be liable for lost data, lost profits, or any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use or inability to use mdbeaver.

## 8. Changes to the Terms
These terms may be updated from time to time. Continued use of the app after an update constitutes acceptance of the revised terms. The revision date will always be listed at the top of this document.

## 9. Contact and Support
Support is available via the contact method described in `SUPPORT.md`. If you disagree with these terms, discontinue use of mdbeaver immediately.
